## Build tools & versions used
I used the latest Xcode 14.2.
and deployment target 14.0 for some modern Swift API

## Steps to run the app
Build and run the project from Xcode.
Run tests for tests.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I focused on modern Swift API and architecture. Also, I spend almost a third of my time on writing tests.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
I was trying to solve the problem of extensive coupling, which regularly appears in iOS projects. As a lead and senior developer, I find this higher-level skill very valuable. As part of it, I spend time writing tests to show how decoupling and decomposition help in testing. At the same time, I tried to keep things simple and overengineer the code.

For my architecture, I used the MVVM approach. Combine is a great tool here to build an event-based architecture. 
I wrote unit tests for most classes to test their functionality.

**Models** here are `Employee` and `EmployeesData`. They are parsed from the response and provide basic data representation manipulations.
**ViewModel** is responsible for delivering data ready for a representation by `ViewController`, which is `View` in this scenario. The view is responsible for showing all the data. The presentation is defined by `State`, propagated by the view model and the value needed to render each state.

## How long did you spend on this project?
I've spent around 6 hours over two days, excluding writing this readme.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I've spent less time on the UI. I used the most basic implementations, but I would use more custom elements to have more control over how the app looks like.

I also should have spent more time commenting on my code.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Some parts may be more challenging to read, and this is because I only left a few comments.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
I decided to go all standard. I used no external libraries to keep the project simple and small. But I would like to list some of those which would help me speed up in case of scaling:
- SDWebImage for image manipulations and cashing
- SnapKit for UIkit constraints and autolayout.
- WithKit (developed by me) to help create UIKit elements

Of course, I used some parts of the boilerplate code from SO.
